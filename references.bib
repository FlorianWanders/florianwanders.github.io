abstract = {In the social sciences, there is a longstanding tension between data collection methods that facilitate quantification and those that are open to unanticipated information. Advances in technology now enable new, hybrid methods that combine some of the benefits of both approaches. Drawing inspiration from online information aggregation systems like Wikipedia and from traditional survey research, we propose a new class of research instruments called wiki surveys. Just as Wikipedia evolves over time based on contributions from participants, we envision an evolving survey driven by contributions from respondents. We develop three general principles that underlie wiki surveys: they should be greedy, collaborative, and adaptive. Building on these principles, we develop methods for data collection and data analysis for one type of wiki survey, a pairwise wiki survey. Using two proof-of-concept case studies involving our free and open-source website www.allourideas.org, we show that pairwise wiki surveys can yield insights that would be difficult to obtain with other methods.},

@article{Goel2016,
abstract = {Viral products and ideas are intuitively understood to grow through a person-to-persondiusion process analogous to the spread of an infectious disease; however, until recently it hasbeen prohibitively dicult to directly observe purportedly viral events, and thus to rigorouslyquantify or characterize their structural properties. Here we propose a formal measure of whatwe label $\backslash$structural virality" that interpolates between two extremes: content that gains itspopularity through a single, large broadcast, and that which grows through multiple generationswith any one individual directly responsible for only a fraction of the total adoption. We use thisnotion of structural virality to analyze a unique dataset of a billion diusion events on Twitter,including the propagation of news stories, videos, images, and petitions. We nd that the verylargest observed events nearly always exhibit high structural virality, providing some of the rstdirect evidence that many of the most popular products and ideas grow through person-to-persondiusion. However, medium-sized events|having thousands of adopters|exhibit surprisingstructural diversity, and regularly grow via both broadcast and viral mechanisms. We ndthat these empirical results are largely consistent with a simple contagion model characterizedby a low infection rate spreading on a scale-free network, reminiscent of previous work on thelong-term persistence of computer viruses},
